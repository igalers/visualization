# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good visualization (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmitry.shirikov/viz/SpotifyBillionsClub_17340200627600/Dash):

      Using the framework from the class discussions:

      Aesthetic: This visualization is easy on the eye, colors are vibrant but not distracting from the data itself. There's a lot of blank space to contrast the colors so it makes it easier for the audience to focus on the main point of the visualization, which is the most listened-to artists on Spotify. Using different colors to indicate different categories enhances user experience and ensure a smoother transition between them. Image use is also very helpful to literally put the faces on some of these names, increasing the appeal of the visualization.

      Substantive: It's not the densest visualization of all time but it definitely packs a lot of information and gets the point across successfully. We instantly know the most popular artists on Spotify in general and in their respective categories (male solo, female solo and band). Combination of data and images delivers more than the sum of its individual components. Whether you're a Spotify aficionado or a simple user or even a non-user, you can easily understand the purpose of the visualization.
      
      Perceptual: Connected to what's said above, first and foremost, I can say the cognitive load is not too high.
      Especially the amount of white space between the two main objects in the visualization lowers the cognitive load. In addition, the title - which alludes to the billionaires' club - signifies exclusivity of these artists in the upper echelon of the music world. Even if you were a time traveler who didn't know anything about these artists, you'd understand that they're at the top of their fields in terms of popularity. 

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      There are two areas in which this visualization can be improved: accessibility and reproducibility. For the visually impaired for example, an audio assistant that reads the content of the visualization would be very helpful. On the reproducibility front, if the cited data sources were direct links to the Spotify API, it would be much clearer. Also Google search is not necessarily a reliable source so it definitely reduces the credibility of the sources used to create this overall successful visualization.  


      Bad visualization (https://www.behance.net/gallery/26847499/WIRED-UK-Infoporn-Murderous-Measurements/modules/175405633):

      Aesthetic: In contrast to the good visualization example, this one looks a bit crowded, reducing the efficiency of using color. There's almost no blank space to contrast the colors which adds to the sensation of crowd in the viz. Although I find the shadow use in the coloring to provide some reprieve from that sensation, it's still not as easy on the eye. On the positive side, using different colors to indicate different countries does enhance viewer experience and ensure clean cut separation between the data from each countries represented. The text looks a bit bulky but is very informative.

      Substantive: I think this visualization fares better in this aspect than others. In terms of substance, the visualization presents a well-researched and data-rich exploration of homicide rates, methods, and geographical variations. It effectively presents statistical information, providing insights into the prevalence and nature of murders across different contexts. However, some parts could benefit from deeper contextual explanations or comparative analysis to strengthen the narrative.

      Perceptual: Some densely packed information and subtle visual cues might overwhelm or confuse less experienced viewers. In terms of cognitive load, it's certainly higher than the example of the good visualization. Improving the hierarchy of information and adding clearer labels could enhance clarity and retention. The text at the top does offer a helpful introduction to the visual, giving it a more real-life context and making it more relatable than just cold hard data while maintaining objectivity, especially with a credible researcher as a source right from the get go.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Some areas of the visualization could benefit from more precise labeling or additional context to enhance clarity. For example, certain data points and graphics might not immediately convey their meaning to all viewers, especially without clear legends or explanatory text. Improving these elements could make the visualization more accessible and ensure the intended narrative is easily understood by a broader audience.
      Much like the example of the good viz, an audio assistant that reads the content of the visualization would be very helpful. Although the researcher whose research informs the visualization is mentioned and quoted, a link to the research paper itself would help in terms of reproducibility.

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
