Visualization 1 (Python):
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
      Python
    > Who is your intended audience? 
      Current and potential cycling community members who live in the GTA, visitors who'd like to see where cycling is available 
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
      Show the network of cycling roads in the GTA that cyclists can enjoy 
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
      Substantive was my priority, as a novice in the data visualization and and a relatively recent resident of the GTA itself, my goal was to provide a map for cyclists.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
      The visualization I created on Python has the code available with the comments - which increases its reproducibility.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
      Colors help the visualization of the markers on the map. In addition, viewers have access to the coordinates of each cycling road on the map so with a Google Maps search, they can find out how to access those physical spots. 
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
      Individuals, families, communities with access to bicycles and other similar vehicles
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
      I wanted to focus on the locations rather than types of cycling roads which were available in the raw data. That was more suitable for my introductory understanding of map building in Python.
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
      Trying to figure out what packages to use in Python, a lot of trial and error in coding, identifying the metrics of the raw data.
