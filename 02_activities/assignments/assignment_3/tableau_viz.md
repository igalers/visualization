Visualization 2 (Tableau):
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
      Tableau Public
    > Who is your intended audience? 
      Current and potential cycling community members who live in the GTA, visitors who'd like to see what kinds of cycling roads are available within the network
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
      Display the street names and the kind of cycling roads available in those streets within the GTA
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
      Substantive was my priority again as this was my first time ever working with Tableau. My idea was to create a visualization that complements the map I created in Python. It's rather a simple visualization. Viewers who are planning to cycle can identify where in the GTA they'd like to go from the map first and then check what kinds of cycling roads are available there.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?
      Unfortunately, since this was made on Tableau, it's not reproducible - which might have an negative impact on the reliability of the visualization.  
      The visualization I created on Python has the code available with the comments - which increases its reproducibility.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
      I increased font size to make it more accessible. Given the nature of the table, I didn't play with colors too much. I had the idea of adding gridlines to make the markers to more distinguishable, however that increased the cognitive load and made the visualization very crowded.
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
      Individuals, families, communities with access to bicycles and other similar vehicles
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
      As suggested earlier, this was meant to be a complementary tool to the other visualization. Therefore, for this one, I focused on the types of cycling roads available within the Greater Toronto Area. I excluded the coordinates and the data on when the roads were installed.
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
      Watching how-to videos using the sources available on Tableau and other sources, trial and error on multiple sheets
